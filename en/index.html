                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Vinícius Flesch Kern, I'm a 17 year old high school student who loves programming, robots, and nature!
                </p>
                <p>
                    &emsp;As of now it has been 5 years since I have first touched my first "Hello World". At the start, I did a bit of coding in Lua on Roblox, but never got too focused on it, then later I started doing some web development courses that I found online for two or three years until I thought myself able to move on into more advanced topics such as back-end.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &emsp;At first I did some PHP courses, but to be honest, I really didn't like it so I decided to move on, which was when i found the Node.js which I did enjoy for some time but eventually decided to change languages once again. At one point whilst going on about my day I found some courses regarding Java from an institute of technology here from my state, and because Minecraft was one of my first ever computer games i had played, I always have had a bit of curiosity for Java, so i gave it a try, and that was it: I found my language of choice for Back-end development. Besides that I also learned some databases such as MySQL and PostrgreSQL as now I needed to store data for some of my apps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &emsp;As I have mentioned that I like robots, it's necessary to say that in the breaks I had from web development, I picked up coding on Arduino, which was yet another wonderful experience: seeing the things you built come to life in the very front of you and you being able to handle them as howhever you designed, as opposed to just appearing on a screen. Together with that I also did some projects with the Esp32 due to it's compatibility with Arduino's language and more much more powerful specs compared to the Arduino Uno I had, which led to some more advanced projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &emsp;Regarding nature, I have always loved camping and staying outside, that's why at the age of 10 I joined my city's Scout Group where I learned a lot about ethics and how to handle myself in stressful situations.
